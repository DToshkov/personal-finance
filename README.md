### Personal Finance Database and Tracker

### **Introduction** 
In this project, I developed a MySQL database called personal finance tracking all of my financial transactions. This includes purchases, deposits, withdraws, credit card payments, and more. Any transaction that results in a change in a bank account or credit card balance is tracked in this database. These transactions are extracted from my banking website in the form of CSV files, transformed using customized Python scripts, and loaded into the database via the SQLAlchemy Python library. I then created SQL views to understand my spending habits and developed a Power BI dashboard linked to the database to view these habits visually.

### **Technologies and Skills** 

- **Technologies;** PHPMyAdmin, MySQL Workbench, Python, Java

### Inspiration 
I want to know more about my spending habits and my current financial standing. I have an idea of where my personal finances are, however, this tool will track my day to day financial standings. I want to have a way to stay on top of my spending habits and investments.
